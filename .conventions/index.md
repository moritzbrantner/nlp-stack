This directory is managed by `coding-tooling conventions`. Do not edit these snapshots directly.
Repository-specific rules and exceptions belong in `AGENTS.md`.

## Rule briefing

Read this section first. Open the linked managed source when a rule is relevant, ambiguous, or needs its full context.

- **PRINCIPLE-001 — Prefer determinism over inference** — Prefer executable checks, deterministic mappings, explicit baselines, and structured ownership over semantic inference. ([details](modules/base/principles/README.md))
- **PRINCIPLE-002 — Structure should encode agent-relevant information** — Use paths, hierarchy, names, and local instructions to communicate scope, ownership, relevance, and dependencies. ([details](modules/base/principles/README.md))
- **PRINCIPLE-003 — Validate progressively** — Run the narrowest, cheapest affected checks first; expand only after they pass. ([details](modules/base/principles/README.md))
- **PRINCIPLE-004 — Make completion observable** — Completion is defined by repository-owned, independently repeatable gates—not agent confidence. ([details](modules/base/principles/README.md))
